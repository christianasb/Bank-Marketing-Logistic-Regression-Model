# **Bank Marketing Logistic Regression Analysis**

**Objective:** Predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on data from a Portuguese bank's marketing campaign, to improve targeting strategies and maximize profit.

**Key Tasks:**
- Load and explore the dataset using pandas
- Preprocess data (handle nulls, encode categorical variables, scale features, and split into training/testing sets)
- Train a logistic regression model using scikit-learn 
- Interpret model results using odds ratios and statistical significance (p-values) to identify key predictors
- Evaluate model performance using classification reports, confusion matrices, precision-recall curve, and learning curve
- Determine classification threshold that balances precision and recall to maximize profit
- Estimate profit at different targeting levels to inform campaign scope
- Scale expected profit to align with business objectives
- Recommend a tiered outreach strategy based on predicted probabilities

**Tools Used:** 
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** - data cleaning and manipulation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** - data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** - model training and evaluation
- **Statsmodels** - statistical analysis
- **Google Colab** - notebook environment
